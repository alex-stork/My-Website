  <article class="about_me">
    <p>
      I am a Texas A&M graduate, class of 2016, majored in Economics. I really enjoy working with computers and technology, because it's all connected and can be constantly improved upon.
      I like to play video games, work out, and hang out with my wife and family. I have an incredibly analytic mindset and love to work with numbers and logic. I discovered Programming in college but
      have only recently become passionate about it 3 years later. I realized that with my analytical mindset and stengths with computers, I'd be a fantastic programmer if I took the time to learn.</p>

    <p>
      When I graduated college in 2016, I actually began working in the Logistics and Supply Chain industry, working my way up from a Customer Service Associate to an Operations Project Manager.
      I actually believe coming from a background in Logistics rather than jumping straight into programming is actually a benefit, as it allows me to bring a new perspective to the team.
      I am actively seeking a role in programming and software development, but understand that getting programming experience under my belt is necessary first.</p>

    <p>
      I am now currently working on a NanoDegree through Udacity on Front-End Web Development, and have been tirelessly studying and working on code since the beginning of 2019.
      My goal is to continue to self-teach until I have general basic knowledge of both front-end and back-end development, and/or I have the opportunity to work in a programming job where I can
      practice my skills in real application.</p>
