        <p class="content">
          My name is Alex Stork, and I am an aspiring Front-End Web Developer. I graduated from the University of Texas A&M in 2016, with a Bachelor's of Science in Economics. I really enjoy working with computers and technology, because it's all
          connected and can be constantly improved upon.</p>

        <p class="content">
          I like to play video games, work out, and hang out with my wife and family. I have a very analytic mindset and love to work with numbers and logic. I discovered when I took a Programming course in college but
          have only recently become passionate about it in 2019. I realized that with my logical way of thinking and my stengths with computers, I'd be a fantastic programmer if I took the time to learn.</p>

        <p class="content">When I graduated college in 2016, I actually began working in the Logistics and Supply Chain industry, working my way up from a Customer Service Associate to an Operations Project Manager.
          I actually believe coming from a background in Logistics rather than jumping straight into programming is actually a benefit, as it allows me to bring a new perspective to a programming team.</p>

        <p class="content">I am now currently working on a NanoDegree through Udacity on Front-End Web Development, and have been tirelessly studying and working on code.
          My goal is to continue to self-teach until I have general basic knowledge of both front-end and back-end development, and/or I have the opportunity to work in a programming job where I can
          practice my skills in real application.</p>
